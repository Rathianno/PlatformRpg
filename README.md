Hello! this is just a practice for making a game in Unity.

Currently, the goals are simple. Make a character that's able to move around and push objects, I want to give him a simple attack and maybe make some damage numbers appear, but it's been tough, so it might take a little bit

# Development Environment

I used unity, and a game kit with all the art used from Thomas Brush/AtmosGames.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
I'm still guessing, but I want to use this as an opportunity to learn more about working with graphics, programming my own shaders.
